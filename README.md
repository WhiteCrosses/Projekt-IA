## Desired mechanics:
1. Touhou - inspired playstyle.
2. Randomness - best achieved by system of cards that player chooses. Their effect would stack creating (possibly) interesting combos.
3. Very rapid flow of the game. A lot happening on the screen. Little time to act when e.g. choosing card or making other decisions.
## Technology
>SDL2
>C++
## Cards
Each card would have one positive and one negative effect (possibly random generation of cards?).

Card choosing menu would appear often, making player change playstyle flexibly.
## Graphical style
SDL2 generated graphics that should represent terminal-based apps. SDL2 allows to make sprites move in distance smaller than one terminal cell, rotate them, change sizes and overlay.
